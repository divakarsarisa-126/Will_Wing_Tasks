#_(1)Program 1: Create a class with a method which can calculate the sum of first n natural numbers which are divisible by 3 or 5.

Method Name 	calculateSum 
Method Description 	Calculate Sum 
Argument 	int n 
Return Type 	int-sum 
Logic 	Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers which are divisible by 3 or 5. 


#_(2)Program2: Create a class with a method to find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.

Method Name 	calculateDifference 
Method Description 	Calculate the difference 
Argument 	int n 
Return Type 	int - Sum 
Logic 	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of their sum. 
For Example if n is 10,you have to find   
(1^2+2^2+3^2+….9^2+10^2)- 
(1+2+3+4+5…+9+10)^2 


#_(3)Program3: Create a class containing a method to create the mirror image of a String. The method should return the two Strings separated with a pipe(|) symbol .

Method Name 	getImage 
Method Description 	Generate the mirror image of a String and add it to the existing string. 
Argument 	String 
Return Type 	String 
Logic 	Accepts One String 
Find the mirror image of the String 
Add the two Strings together separated by a pipe(|) symbol. 
For Example 
Input : EARTH 
Output : EARTH|HTRAE 
Hint: Use StringBuffer API (Ex: For this problem reverse method in Stringbuffer can be used) 
Note: Learn the other APIs in StringBuffer 


#_(4)Program4: Create a method to check if a number is an increasing number

Method Name 	checkNumber 
Method Description 	Check if a number is an increasing number 
Argument 	int number 
Return Type 	boolean 
Logic 	A number is said to be an increasing number if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left. 
For Example : 134468 is an increasing number 

#_(5)Program5:Example 5: Create a method to check if a number is a power of two or not

Method Name 	checkNumber 
Method Description 	Checks if the entered number is a power of two or not 
Argument 	int n 
Return Type 	boolean 
Logic 	Check if the input is a power of two. 
Ex: 8 is a power of 2
